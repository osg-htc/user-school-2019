<p><span style="color: #FF6600;">This page is for Non-Resident Aliens only.</span>  If you are a United States citizen or
permanent resident, this page does not apply to you.</p>
<p>For the University of Wisconsin to pay for your travel, hotel, or meal expenses, we must have certain personal
information from you.  We collect as little information as possible and do not share it except with University
administrative staff who need it.  Most of what we need comes from the online form you completed after accepting our
invitation to attend.</p>
<p>When you come to the School in Madison, we will need to look at and verify your travel documents.  Please bring all
travel documents to the School!</p>
<p>Note: If you are not being reimbursed for any meals and/or travel for the school or if you are from UW-Madison or the
Madison area, these documents are not required.</p>
<h2 id="tasks-to-do-now">Tasks To Do Now<a class="headerlink" href="#tasks-to-do-now" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Please check your passport and visa for travel in the United States now.  Make sure that all documents are valid from
now and until after the School ends.  If any documents are expired or will expire before the end of the School:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell us immediately, so that we can help you</li>
<li>Begin the process for updating your documents immediately</li>
<li>Do whatever you can to expedite the update process</li>
</ul>
<p>The University of Wisconsin cannot pay for or reimburse you for costs without valid travel documents.  We have no
control over this policy and there are no exceptions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #FF6600; font-weight: bolder;">If you are in the United States on a J-1 Scholar visa,</span> there
are extra steps needed to make the University and Federal government happy.  If you have a J-1 visa and have not heard
from us about it already, please email us immediately so that we can help.</p>
<h2 id="documents-to-bring-to-the-school">Documents to Bring to the School<a class="headerlink" href="#documents-to-bring-to-the-school" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When you come to Madison, you must bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>U.S. visa</li>
<li>U.S. Customs and Border Protection <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/i-94">form I-94</a><ul>
<li>If you entered the U.S. before 30 April 2013, the I-94 should be stapled into your passport â€” do not remove it!</li>
<li>If you entered the U.S. after 30 April 2013, the I-94 is stored electronically;
  <a href="https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/recent-search">you can request a copy to print from CBP</a></li>
<li>If you are Canadian, you may use a second form of picture ID instead of the I-94 if you did not obtain an I-94.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional forms specified in the table below:</li>
