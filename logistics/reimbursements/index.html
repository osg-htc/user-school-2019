<p>If you paid for certain expenses to attend the OSG User School 2019, then we will reimburse you for them.  This page
explains what can be reimbursed and how to request reimbursement.  Please read this whole page carefully before
submitting your request.</p>
<p><strong>The deadline for all reimbursement submissions is <span style="color: #FF6600;">Friday, 13 September 2019</span>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-can-be-reimbursed">What Can Be Reimbursed?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-can-be-reimbursed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>We offered to reimburse certain expenses that were part of attending the OSG School:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bus fare to/from Madison</li>
<li>Taxi or ride-share to/from Madison airport</li>
<li>Driving mileage (if prearranged)</li>
<li>Dinners Monday through Thursday (up to $27 per dinner)</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, we are not able to reimburse you for any other expenses (e.g., checked baggage fees, transportation to/from
your home and local airport).  However, if we made specific arrangements with you before the School, those arrangements
are still valid for reimbursement.  When in doubt, contact us before the deadline.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-is-needed">What Information Is Needed?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-information-is-needed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
