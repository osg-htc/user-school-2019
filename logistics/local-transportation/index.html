<h1 id="travel-in-madison">Travel in Madison<a class="headerlink" href="#travel-in-madison" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>You are responsible for your own transportation within Madison, but we will help
coordinate and can reimburse costs between the airport and your hotel.</p>
<h2 id="travel-between-the-madison-airport-and-your-hotel">Travel Between the Madison Airport and Your Hotel<a class="headerlink" href="#travel-between-the-madison-airport-and-your-hotel" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The School hotel (Best Western) provides free shuttle service from and back to
the Madison airport, when available.  <span class="hi">We will help organize
groups</span> to take shuttles and taxis, based on arrival and departure times.
Shuttle/taxi groups will be formed and emailed shortly before the School itself.</p>
<p>Generally, the hotel shuttle is free and direct, so it is the best option
between airport and hotel.  If a shuttle is not available, you may take a taxi
or ride-sharing service and be reimbursed after the School.  There are several
good taxi companies in Madison, including
<a href="https://greencabmadison.com">Green Cab</a>,
<a href="http://www.badgercab.com/">Badger Cab</a>, and
<a href="https://www.unioncab.com/">Union Cab</a>, and both <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>
and <a href="https://www.uber.com/ride/">Uber</a> are active in Madison.  Taxis are readily
available at the Madison airport, but nearly everywhere else (e.g., from your
hotel back to the airport), you should contact the company and request a ride or
make a reservation in advance.  Note that we can reimburse you only for taxi or
ride-sharing rides between the airport and hotel/campus area.</p>
<h2 id="travel-on-and-near-campus">Travel On and Near Campus<a class="headerlink" href="#travel-on-and-near-campus" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Best Western hotel is about 1&frac14; miles (2.1 km) from the classroom
building.  There are many good options for getting between your hotel and the
School, plus other sights, restaurants, and other activities in Madison.</p>
<h3 id="walking">Walking<a class="headerlink" href="#walking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It is easy to walk in and around the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison
campus.  Use a mapping app or ask us or your hotel for a map.  In particular,
State Street&nbsp;&mdash; which connects the Capitol Square with the UW
campus&nbsp;&mdash; is full of great shops and restaurants and is worth
strolling along while you are here.</p>
<h3 id="hotel-shuttle">Hotel Shuttle<a class="headerlink" href="#hotel-shuttle" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>See above; the hotel has a free shuttle that can be used to transport students
between the hotel and the School&hellip; and other places.  Ask the hotel for
more information and availability.</p>
<h3 id="city-of-madison-metro-bus-service">City of Madison Metro Bus Service<a class="headerlink" href="#city-of-madison-metro-bus-service" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Many <a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro">Madison Metro</a> buses stop near the
hotels and pass through the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison campus.  Bus
fare is $2.00, and transfers from one route to another are free.  If you plan to
use buses to travel to and from the School every day, contact us, and we may be
able to buy a bus pass for you or explain how to do so.</p>
<p>The official
<a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/routes-schedules">Madison Metro Bus page</a>
provides route maps and times for all Madison buses.  Google Maps and the
Wisconsin phone app also do a good job.</p>
<h3 id="taxis-and-ride-sharing-services">Taxis and Ride-Sharing Services<a class="headerlink" href="#taxis-and-ride-sharing-services" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As listed above in the airport-hotel section, there are several taxi companies
and ride sharing services in Madison.  <strong>Note:</strong> We can reimburse you only for
transportation for School purposes, not personal reasons, and even then, only
for trips between the airport and either the hotel or the classroom building.</p>
<h3 id="madison-bcycle">Madison BCycle<a class="headerlink" href="#madison-bcycle" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Madison is a great city to bike in, and there is even a short-term bike rental
system called <a href="https://madison.bcycle.com">BCycle</a> here.  For instance, it is
possible to pick up a bike at Union South, next to the classroom building, and
then drop it off at one of many locations around the central part of Madison.
See the website for more details.  While not terribly expensive, this is not a
cost that we can reimburse.</p>
