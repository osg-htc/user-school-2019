<p>After Wednesday morning instruction and lunch, there are no required instructional activities.  Therefore, you are free
to explore Madison, rest, or stick around and talk to instructors or work on your projects.</p>
<p>Please note that <em>School-Organized Activities</em> are all free and walkable.  If you are interested in the <em>On Your Own</em>
activities also listed, or prefer not to walk, you will be responsible for you own transportation costs and activity
costs.  We cannot reimburse transportation costs for these Wednesday afternoon activities.</p>
